### CODING CHALLENGE #2: REPORT

At the beginning it was challenging because I was getting some errors. The first mistake I was making was using too many "if" without using else if. The second mistake I was making was, in all of the blood pressures I was using "and" when in some of the I had to use "or" or "and/or". In this challenge I learned the way of coding something withouth using too many "if" and how to put some codes together by using (()).
